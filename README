# j2cpp

I chose this name as there are already two other repositories named j2c and so I thought of j2c++, but it's is rather stupid (if not even impossible?) to include special characters in a name. So, it ended up j2cpp.

## What can it do?

It takes your Java classes and returns a C++-Header and a C++-Implementation file for every of your classes. That's it!

## What is so cool about it?

The Java code you have written becomes proud, native C++-code. I do my best porting a bit of special Java langugage-constructs and Java lib into C++ and that is what really is your benefit.

## What are it's aims?

* performant
* highly configurative
=> It is YOU who has written the Java classes and it is YOU who should control, what your classes look like in C++ (consider more than one class per file etc.)
* easy to use = no need of configuration
